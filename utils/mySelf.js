        Hello! My name is Kshitish Kumar Moharana, and I’m passionate about creating new things for the internet. My journey into programming started at a young age when I found myself exploring the world of coding through simple activities like playing with colors in Inspect Element, experimenting with loops, and even trying my hand at screen-overflow tricks. These early experiences sparked my love for programming, and by the age of 16, I knew I wanted to turn this passion into a career.

        Programming, to me, is a powerful way to bring my ideas to life and explore the endless possibilities of technology. It allows me to be creative while solving problems, and I find it truly exciting to keep learning and improving.

        Besides programming, I’m also an avid photographer and traveler. One of my proudest achievements is being the first Pakistani to contribute significantly to Google Street View in Karachi, helping millions of people navigate the city. This experience taught me a lot about the importance of persistence and attention to detail.

        As a fresher in programming, I’m eager to apply my skills and collaborate with teams to create impactful solutions. I’ve worked on a variety of small projects, and each one has provided me with valuable insights into working with different people and cultures. From freelancing on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to collaborating with local teams, I’ve gained experience that has sharpened my ability to adapt and learn quickly.

        I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to test and grow my skills. I believe there’s always room for improvement and that every new experience is a chance to learn something valuable. I’m excited to contribute to projects, learn from experienced professionals, and grow as a programmer`,
